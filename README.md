By Frank Force - 2019

ZzFX Seed Browser UI
- **http://zzfx.3d2k.com**

ZzFX Features
- Micro synth engine with 6 controllable parameters, you can add more.
- Seeded sounds can also be played using as few as 4 bytes, ex: z(3)
- Able to produce a wide variety of sound effect types.
- Tiny footprint, after being minified, ZzFX is only 352 bytes!

ZzFX UI Features
- The UI is just a seed browser for ZzFX.
- When the page loads it is filled with cards each corresponding to a seed.
- Click on a card to play the sound for that seed.
- Each card also has a unique visual apearance tied to that seed.
- You can click on the ZzFX logo to copy the last played seed or change it!
- There is a section in code to create a preset card layout.

Additional notes...
- Be careful of variable name collisions! vars used are ZzFfXRr, don't use them.
- If you use closure compiler, it will shorten the internal variable names.
- You can use R() instead of Math.Random() to save space.
- Feel free to completely modify any of this code!
- Try playing multiple sounds at once for unique effects.
- You can also use negative seeds.
- There is built in 5% frequency randomness in z(), you can change it.
- You may want to add parameters to z(), like a volume setting for example.

**Here's the latest version of the minfied code you can use directly!**
